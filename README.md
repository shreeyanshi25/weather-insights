# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# 🌍✨ **_Weather Insights_** ✨🌍 
A React + Vite web app that displays real-time weather and the latest city news using OpenWeather and NewsAPI.


## **_🌤️ Weather & News App_**

This is a small project I built using **React + Vite**.  
It lets you check the **weather of any city** and also see the **latest news headlines** related to that city.  

I made this project to practice working with APIs, React hooks, and CSS.

- 🌡️ Shows temperature, humidity, and wind speed  
- ⛅ Weather condition icons (sunny, cloudy, rain, etc.)

## **_🚀 How to Run the Project Locally_**

1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shreeyanshi25/weather-news-app.git
   cd weather-news-app
   Install dependencies

2. Install dependencies
   npm install



3. Create a .env file in the root folder and add your API keys

VITE_APP_ID=your_openweather_api_key
VITE_NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key


4. Start the app locally

npm run dev


I deployed this project on Vercel because it’s free and easy for React + Vite apps.

Steps I followed:

Pushed my code to GitHub

Added my API keys in Project Settings → Environment Variables
