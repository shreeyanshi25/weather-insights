# weather-insights
A React + Vite web app that displays real-time weather and the latest city news using OpenWeather and NewsAPI.


## **_🌤️ Weather & News App_**

This is a small project I built using **React + Vite**.  
It lets you check the **weather of any city** and also see the **latest news headlines** related to that city.  

I made this project to practice working with APIs, React hooks, and CSS.
